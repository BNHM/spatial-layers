There is some weirdness with the PRK provinces. According to Wikipedia, there are 11 adminstrative regions, however, there are fourteen included in the GADM shapefile. According to wikipedia: "The three special administrative regions were all created in 2002 for the development of collaborative ventures with South Korea and other countries. One of them, the Sinuiju Special Administrative Region, was intended to draw Chinese investment and enterprise, but as of 2006 appears never to have been implemented."
